## Learning physics from video

In this repository you can find the implemenation for the paper Learning Physics From Video: Unsupervised Physical Parameter Estimation for Continuous Dynamical Systems
available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01376

## Dataset

The Real videos used for the experiment can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaswar/physical-parameter-prediction

## Data processing

Our provide code assumes your input data is a pytorch tensor with dimmentions [batch_size, number of frames, channels, width, height].  Therefore, to use the videos from the dataset, you need to transform the .mp4 video to a tensor.

## Execution
